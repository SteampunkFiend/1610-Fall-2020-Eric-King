Weather Report for Aug. 25th 2020 as reported by Eric, the handsome dude.
    Partly Cloudy in Orem, UT with a high of 95 degrees fahrenheit. Might as well be 200 degrees the way it feels.
    Apparently there are supposed rainshowers to appear but that seems highly doubtful.
Anyways, that's the weather. This has been Eric the handsome dude, committing and saving.
